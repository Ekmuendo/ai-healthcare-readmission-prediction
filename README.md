# 🧠 AI Healthcare Readmission Prediction

This repository contains a complete AI assignment centered on predicting hospital readmission risk within 30 days of patient discharge. It includes all critical phases of AI development—from problem definition to deployment—with a focus on ethical and practical concerns in healthcare AI.

## 🏥 Case Study Overview

### Problem
Hospitals need a reliable way to predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days to optimize care and reduce costs.

### Objectives
- Predict readmission risk using EHR and patient data
- Assist clinicians with discharge planning
- Reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient outcomes

### Stakeholders
- Healthcare providers
- Patients
- Hospital administrators

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- Supervised machine learning (classification)
- Random Forest model (proposed)
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall
- Bias and concept drift analysis
- Deployment strategy with regulation considerations (HIPAA, etc.)

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

- Bias in training data (race, insurance status, etc.)
- Patient privacy & data handling
- Trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

- Python (planned for model dev)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- scikit-learn (suggested)
- FPDF for report generation

## 🔁 AI Workflow Stages

1. Problem Definition
2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
3. Model Development
4. Evaluation & Deployment
5. Bias Reflection & Optimization
6. Workflow Diagram + Reflection
