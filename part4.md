# 🔁 Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)

## 1. Reflection (5 points)

**Most Challenging Part:**  
📌 *“Data Strategy & Preprocessing”* — It required aligning technical accuracy with ethical and real-world constraints. Balancing the need for clean, structured data while protecting patient privacy was a tough line to walk.

**How I Would Improve With More Time/Resources:**  
- Collect a more diverse dataset from multiple hospitals  
- Collaborate with domain experts (doctors, nurses) for better feature engineering  
- Explore fairness-aware machine learning libraries like `Fairlearn`  
- Deploy a prototype and collect real user feedback to iterate
